Main Processing Steps:
1. Read LORA .root files (V1 or V2 formats).
2. Load detector positions, signals, gains, logs, and noise data.
3. Reconstruct event-level parameters:
   - Arrival time differences
   - Shower direction (zenith, azimuth)
   - Shower core position
   - Energy estimates and particle densities
4. Write results to:
   - `.dat` (human-readable summary),
   - `.h5` (ADC traces),
   - `.nur` (NuRadioReco binary format).

Functions:
- write_nur(evt, detectors, ev, outputdir, run_number, event_id):
    Converts a reconstructed event into a NuRadioReco .nur file.
- ProcessEventV2(outputdir, data_dir, root_name, run_number=0):
    Full processing chain for a single ROOT file 
    (adapted from scripts by Lucas Van Dongen).

Imported Modules (project-specific):
- LORAparameters : constants and detector setup parameters.
- process_functions : helper routines for event processing.
- read_functions : readers for ROOT files, logs, and noise data.
- detector : detector and LASA classes with calibration loaders.
- event : event reconstruction routines (timing, core, energy, density).

Usage:
    Set the `date`, `data_dir`, and `outputdir` variables inside the script.
    The script will automatically find all .root files for the given date 
    and process them. Results will be written to the specified output directory.

Notes:
    - Use `.dat` files for quick human-readable inspection.
    - Use `.h5` files for detailed ADC traces and further numeric analysis.
    - Use `.nur` files for NuRadioReco-based workflows.
V1 format = older LORA ROOT file structure (before 2019-11-16).
V2 format = newer ROOT file structure (after 2019-11-16).
